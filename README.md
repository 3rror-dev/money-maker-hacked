# Money Maker | Hacked
Have you played the chromium extension clicker game 'Make Money'?
Have you thought that it's very slow, even with an autoclicker and takes up too much time to progress?
Well you're in luck because **I've just hacked it to make it easier**!

## Important Notice
**Update Tab Error _(UTE)_**
Now first of all, after hacking it, for some reason there was a bug where once you opened the *updates* tab, all the other tabs go blank, meaning that it'll become **impossible** to play unless you re-open the game.
So as a temporary solution, I've rendered it **off limits**. So now you can't open the _updates_ tab to cause the error! Great solution, right?

Because of this bug, I can't write what I hacked in the game's changelogs, so I'll have to write it here.

## What Changed?
### INFO
- Look, this hacked version of the game won't be like other mods. Some details are listed:
1. You **won't** get _infinite_ money.
2. Everything **won't** be _free_.
3. You **won't** get _infinite_ or a _crazy amount_ of money per click.

### THE CHANGES
- And now to list all the changes I've made.
- **OVERPOWERING THE PLAYER:**
1. Items are **100x** more _OP_! This means that the income increase has been **multiplied by 100**. For example, the water bottle originally only increases your income per click (IpC) by +1, but now the increase in IpC is now **+100**!
2. Prestiging is now **2x** more _OP_! This means that now when you prestige, you get a permanent **+100%** boost instead of the **original** +50%.
3. Upgrades are now **ON _50%_ SALE**! This means that the upgrades now cost **half** the price they are originally!

- **MISC/CONTENT CHANGES**
1. The help section has been updated. The **navigation** section now has details on the _UTE_.
2. The **money** and **upgrades** tab names are now bold as they are very much the most important.
3. The **updates** tab button has been _disabled_ and _rendered unusable_.
4. The intro animation got changed! The original creator, **ECONOMICAL GAMES** has been strikethroughed, and below it has been added the text "HACKED BY **ERROR DEV**".
5. The extention's version has been changed to _7.7.0_, with _0_ in place for '_Hacked_', which you can see in the game, it says "V7.7.HACKED".
6. The extension's **name** and **short name** has been edited (can be seen in the `manifest.json` file. The **name** is now "Make Money | Hacked by Error Dev" and the **short name** is now "Make Money | Hacked".
